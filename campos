$M007$RA_Rationale
[1] "This Macrogroup is threatened due to high levels of historical rate of change. "

$M007$RA_Summary
[1] "The assessment of the Longleaf Pine Woodland Macrogroup was based on a consistent subset of its potential distribution. It appears to be Critically Endangered (CR), due to very high levels of the historical rate of decline in distribution."

$M007$RA_Criterion_A2a_Comments
[1] "Two different estimates of current geographic distribution are based on available time series of percentage tree cover derived from LandSat imagery between 2000 and 2014 \\citep{Hansen2013} and land cover classification derived from Modis data between 2001 and 2012 \\citep{IGBP2010}. Initial estimates range between 93690.5 -- 130763.1 km$^2$, and final estimates range between 97246.6 -- 127794.9 km$^2$. These sources suggest contradictory rates of change in forest coverage during this period (IGBPa, IGBPb increasing vs. GFC decreasing) and subsequently divergent estimates of future changes. Extrapolation of the proportional rate of decline between 2000 and 2050 suggest categories of LC for subcriterion A2a. Prediction for the next 50 years suggest category LC according to subcriterion A2b."

For IGBPa, IGBPb, the distribution seems to be stable or increasing in the future (trends not shown). For GFC, the expected future decline was extrapolated under the assumption of a proportional rate of decline (solid line)"

$M007$RA_Criterion_A3_Comments
[1] "Historical estimates of geographic distribution are based on the potential extent of woodlands within the validated range of the Macrogroup for the last four centuries \\citep{Anthromes}. A coservative estimate includes only wild and seminatural woodlands that represent more pristine conditions, while a second estimate includes also populated woodlands (A third option which also includes residential woodlands is shown in the figure but was discarded from the assessment). Inital extent in 1700 is between 228351.4 -- 231084.5 km$^2$, while by the year 2000 it is calculated as 6592.0 -- 80901.8 km$^2$. Based on these estimates, the anual absolute rate of decline is around 531.3 km$^2$ per year, and the proportional rate of decline is 0.28 percent per year . The percent of reduction in extent for the whole period considered is 65.0 -- 97.1, hence this Macrogroup is Critically Endangered (CR) under subcriterion A3."
